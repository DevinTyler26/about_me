          <p>
            As you know, I love chipotle! Here is a little bit about that!<br>
            <br>
            Do you get sick/tired of it? - No, they have enough variety that I am able to switch up my meals enough to not get sick of it.<br>
            <br>
            What do you get? - This depends on what I am trying to do. Bulk up? Anything and everything. Double meat, guac (yes I know it is extra), rice, beans, all the salsas. All of the calories I can fit into my stomach, I need. Cutting down? I’ll stick to a chicken or steak bowl, 4oz white rice or 4oz of black beans, fajita vegetables, pico, corn, and lettuce and sometimes cheese. On cheat days, I’ll get gauc and barbocoa. <br>
            <br>
            What do you have to do? - The rules for this challenge are pretty simple for me, I just have to have a meal at Chipotle, once a day, everyday from July 24th 2015 - July 24th 2016. It is a leap year this year, so it adds up to 366 days.<br>
            <br>
            What did you do when they closed? - Drove to Canada... twice. Read below!
            <br>
            How is your stomach? - Completely fine, I have never had any issues with Chipotle upsetting my stomach.<br>
            <br>
            Any secrets when ordering? - If you’re planning on getting extra meat, wait till they scoop the first scoop before telling them you want extra meat. That way you get 2 big scoops. Also, you can get all of the ingredients of a burrito, in a quesadilla.Thank me later...<br>
            <br>
            And the question I get asked the most... Why? - Well, I started this because I want to inspire people to be fit and not give up on their fitness goals. A lot of people try fad/crash diets like a no/low carb diets that does not work and then get discouraged very quickly. I want to show people that they can be fit while still enjoying the food they love. When you enjoy what you eat on your "diet", and you do it in moderation, it is that much easier to achieve your fitness goals. Also, many people said I was going to get fat and sick, so I wanted to prove them wrong. Plus, who wouldn’t want to eat Chipotle everyday for a year?!
